00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Alright, so have you ever asked yourself the question of why Linux and why programmers seem to prefer Linux

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,920
and why Linux just seems to be really hyped among developers? This is a question that I've asked

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,640
myself in the past and especially before starting to use Linux and before starting to learn more

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,520
about Linux. And so I figured as with like most of the videos that I make on this channel that

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,360
if I've had that question in the past then there's probably a decent chance that you're having it

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,160
or have had it too. So that is the question that I'll be answering in today's video which is

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
why Linux. So let's go.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,720
Oh and if you're sitting there and you're thinking where did he get that sick hoodie from,

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,960
you can get yourself one at calstore.com.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,920
Okay, so what is it that actually makes Linux really popular among programmers? Well,

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,080
the answer is that there's actually lots of things but I'm going to go through the major ones that

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,960
I've found that are generally accepted among programmers as like what makes Linux really great

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,080
and from what I've found there's about seven things that programmers in general appreciate about

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,560
Linux. So let's go through them. The first one is security. This simply means that Linux tends to be

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,520
a safer system. So you won't need anti-virus software and viruses overall just aren't really an

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,240
issue. So it's a really secure system and you won't get bothered by needing to find and pay for

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,240
anti-virus software and then update that software and get notified by it etc. Linux just works and

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,200
is safe. The reason that Linux is really secure is because of the fact that the Linux operating system

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,760
is open source. This means that anyone who wants to can look at the source code for the system

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,440
and if you aren't familiar with this concept then this may sound like it would be the

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,800
opposite of safe since anyone can find vulnerabilities and create viruses for it or exploit the

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,840
vulnerabilities really easily and that's not wrong. Anyone can do that and a lot of people do try to

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,640
do this but the thing is that Linux is a really popular operating system and so that means that

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,200
there's so many people reading through the source code every day and like looking for these

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,840
vulnerabilities so that they can patch them themselves because of the fact that they are actually

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,480
using the system themselves so they don't want these vulnerabilities there and so they try to fix

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,440
them and so what ends up happening is that there's actually very very few of these vulnerabilities out

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,960
there and the ones that are out there it become really really hard to find because so many people

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,680
are actually looking for them and that also means that even if there are a few bad people out there

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
looking for these flaws and trying to exploit them in a bad way for every bad person that's out there

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,960
trying to find these flaws there's potentially like a thousand good people out there looking for

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,560
the exact same flaw and trying to eliminate it and so that kind of results in a really safe system.

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,000
The second reason is that Linux can improve your programming workflow. The package manager in Linux

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,040
is a godsend for programmers in terms of efficiency if you want to install something or use something

35
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,200
new just type in pseudo app get install whatever you want to use and then within a couple of seconds

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,240
or a minute or two you get it and you're ready to rock. This is something that can sometimes be

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,760
painstakingly difficult in other operating systems. First of all you need to install a package manager

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,720
in macOS and windows if you want to have a good reliable one and just doing that can be a difficult

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,480
task for a beginner with Linux that just comes pre-installed and you're ready to go and it also has

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,120
a lot of packages already installed and set up. All right so let's take a really simple example

41
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,840
here that kind of illustrates both point number one about security and also point number two

42
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,360
about ease of use and just workflow in general. So let's say that you wanted to install VLC media

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,720
player on your windows machine. What you'd have to do is you'd have to first open up a web browser

44
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,720
of some kind then you'd have to find or like Google search for VLC media player find the right

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,000
actual website to actually download it go to that website press the download link started

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,360
to download it run the xc file and then choose whatever like installation location and then after you've

47
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,640
done all that you potentially also need to restart your computer for these like changes to take

48
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,800
effect or for you to be able to actually use the program. Now let's say that you wanted to do

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,680
that exact same thing but in Linux all you'd have to do is open up a terminal window and type in

50
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,680
pseudo apt get install VLC and hit enter and then you're done. The windows approach leaves a lot

51
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,800
of room for errors to occur you could get to the wrong site and accidentally download malware

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,480
or you could get to the right site but accidentally press one of the thousands of download now buttons

53
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,960
that is actually an ad for something completely different compared to Linux where you just type it

54
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,600
in and it automatically does everything for you making sure to get it from the right source so you

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,480
won't accidentally get the wrong thing or malware as a programmer we usually work with lots of

56
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,040
different technologies and we're installing things constantly to get things to work so making the

57
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,480
process of installing stuff as easy and safe as possible is really important and Linux does this

58
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,200
really well. Oh and while we're on the topic this video is sponsored by kite. Kite is a free

59
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,160
auto completion engine that uses machine learning to provide the completions which is what makes it

60
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,440
stand out and also what makes it the best auto completion engine that I've used. One of the most

61
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,640
useful features is that kites completions are sorted or ranked by relevance instead of by popularity

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,080
or by the alphabet. This is possible because they're using machine learning to provide the completions.

63
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,880
It means that you will get suggested completions based on the code that you're actually writing and if

64
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,920
you're writing code in Python the co-pilot feature offers documentation look up so you don't have to

65
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,960
constantly google search function signatures and call patterns. With kite you can actually write

66
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,040
code up to 18% faster and who doesn't want to write code faster right so I highly recommend that

67
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,400
you download kite and try it out it's completely free and supports up to 13 programming languages

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,360
and 16 IDEs so just give it a go I know that you will like it because I love it. The third reason is

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,080
no rebooting. This is something that I touched on in the previous point when I was explaining about

70
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,320
how installing something in windows might work and how at the end of that process you might end up

71
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,920
having to restart the entire computer just to be able to work with whatever it was you installed

72
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,200
and this is not the case with linux and in fact with linux it's to the point where you can update the

73
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,600
entire operating system without having to actually reboot and this is neither possible with macOS

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,880
nor with windows and it's something that I think is really important because of the fact that as a

75
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,760
programmer we tend to install lots of different things and so the ability to just be able to install

76
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,200
something without then having to reboot the entire machine for those changes to take effect

77
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,680
is something that I think is really important. When doing research for this video I found an article

78
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,480
on tech mint that talks about why linux is often used for servers and this no rebooting point was

79
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,880
one of the reasons according to the article why linux is used for servers this is something that they

80
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,600
touch on in a part of the article where they talk about the fact that linux is built for stability

81
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,560
and reliability. Many linux servers on the internet have been running for years without failure

82
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,000
or even being restarted. The fourth reason is that linux actually comes with a ton of really powerful

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,560
programming tools pre-installed things like grip, wget, cron and lots of other things that once you

84
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,760
learn how they work can be extremely powerful tools that again can help you improve your workflow.

85
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,000
This is a point that's highly individual and it really depends on your specific use case because

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,200
there's so many pre-installed tools that come with linux and it also depends on what specific

87
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,800
distro of linux you choose to go with because certain distros come with certain extra tools like

88
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,240
collie linux for instance comes with a lot of hacking specific tools and so going through all of that

89
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,080
would be an entire standalone video series and I may do that in the future but I won't do that for

90
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,000
now but what I will do is I will leave a link in the description to an article that I found on a

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,400
Ubuntu pit where they go through some of the most commonly used tools in linux and what they're

92
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,440
really useful for so if you feel like learning a little bit more about these tools you can check that out.

93
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,280
Number five on our list is task automation. linux is almost built for automation of tasks. I'm not

94
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,960
an advanced user yet I'm still learning and exploring the wonders of linux but more experienced

95
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,240
linux users who also know how to code rarely need to do anything twice because of the fact that linux

96
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,440
lends itself really well for automation a pretty common thing in the linux community is something

97
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,400
referred to as one liners which is often used to refer to short little scripts that you write to

98
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,560
automate a task you may find yourself doing three things in a row every morning as you start up

99
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,040
your computer maybe you always open up Spotify to play a certain playlist and then you open up your

100
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,760
latest project that you're working on and then you open up Discord by the way check out our

101
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,480
Discord community link in the description with linux it's very easy to write a quick little

102
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,040
script to automate all of these tasks with a simple cron job or something like that there are lots

103
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,360
of pre-installed tools like we talked about in our previous point that lend themselves really

104
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,160
well to automation the sixth point is performance and no linux is not necessarily faster than any other

105
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,200
operating system but it is very lightweight for an OS and it's compatible with pretty much any

106
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,080
machine you can find you can run linux on almost anything so this means that you can very often

107
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,200
take an old laptop that is virtually useless because of being so slow and install linux on that

108
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,000
machine and all of a sudden breathe new life into that a machine that was impossible to work with

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,040
before is now all of a sudden working really well there are more performance benefits of linux like

110
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,560
the reliability of the systems and other things like that but I feel like this is like the major one

111
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,920
like being able to revive a dead computer is something that's really useful I think and it's

112
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,040
also really like environmentally friendly because it means that your laptop running linux will last

113
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,200
you so much longer than one running macOS or windows okay so number seven is a bit of an odd one

114
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,080
but it is that linux actually provides you with useful error messages this may sound a little

115
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,200
weird or whatever but it is really important because with windows and macOS where you can often

116
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,840
find yourself stuck with it's an error message along the lines of like oops something went wrong

117
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,480
and it's not very useful because like googling that and like finding the actual answer to that

118
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,120
question is really difficult because lots of different other people have had that same error

119
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,920
message for lots of different things but with linux instead what you'll get is a full readout

120
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,600
of the actual processes and you'll get like proper you'll actually see what actually happened

121
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,160
and that means that it's way easier to actually google that and find an answer to your specific

122
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,280
problem and that is something that's really important especially for programmers when you're

123
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,320
running into these errors constantly now this also comes with a caveat that a beginner might not

124
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,480
find that much help from these error messages at least not if they've never spent time in a terminal

125
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,200
like interface because for a beginner this can be very intimidating and just seem like a bunch

126
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,520
of text that all says the same thing but once you've spent some time in a terminal these error

127
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,400
messages are super useful all right so secret point number eight this is one that i didn't really

128
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,200
want to include in the main seven points because of the fact that i don't think that it quite

129
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,640
belongs in the seven points i don't think that it's a good reason to choose linux over windows

130
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,320
and macOS but i do think that it's a reason that a lot of linux users kind of like to use so i

131
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,000
wanted to include it in the list anyway and so point number eight is customization and the thing

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,160
about linux is that you can pretty much customize anything and because of the fact that it's open

133
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,960
source you can essentially like it's limitless because you can write your own customizations for it

134
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,280
so you can really actually customize everything and i think that this is something that programmers

135
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,320
tend to care about a lot like customizations and making your environment your own so i think

136
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,840
that it's something that's really important to programmers but like i said i don't think that

137
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,600
it's a reason to choose linux over macOS or windows it's not an actual benefit it's just like a

138
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,120
appearance benefits i guess there could be like benefits of it where you set up the environment to

139
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,120
be more productive for you because you can customize certain things but overall i don't think that it's

140
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,000
a major point to why you should choose linux over windows and macOS but yeah it is a really

141
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,880
interesting point and once you start going down the rabbit hole that is like linux customization

142
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,680
you'll quickly realize that you can spend an entire lifetime there all right so in conclusion

143
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,920
there really aren't that many things that you can do on linux that are impossible to do on other

144
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,840
systems especially if compared with macOS but the overarching theme is ease of use as a rule it's

145
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,200
easier to do what you want to do on linux than it is to do on other operating systems so should you

146
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,160
switch to linux the answer that i like to give here is that you should probably try out linux first

147
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
in a virtual machine and then see what you think of it and then you can kind of go from there

148
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,520
because that's what i did that's how i got started i started out with a virtual machine

149
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,880
and then after a while i just found myself spending more and more time there than i did in my main

150
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,440
OS and especially for like programming related tasks that was just so much smoother to do in linux

151
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,280
than it was to do in my main OS at the time and so that's kind of my advice that's how i would go

152
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,280
about it and yeah that's it for this one i hope i was able to answer the question of why program

153
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,360
ers tend to use linux over other operating systems and yeah that's it for this one i hope you enjoyed it

154
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:46,080
i hope i'll see you in the next one
